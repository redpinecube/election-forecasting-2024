# Forecasting the 2024 U.S. General Election

## Abstract
This paper forecasts the outcome of the 2024 U.S. general election. Using the
poll of polls approach, a Bayesian hierarchical model was developed with data
from FiveThirtyEight using polling data from July 21 to October 19, 2024. The
modelâ€™s prediction is based on the electoral college vote in the seven key swing
states: Arizona, Nevada, Michigan, Georgia, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and North
Carolina to estimate the overall winner. Results indicate that Harris is predicted
to win with a probability of 66%.

## File Structure

The repo is structured as:

-   `data/raw_data` contains the raw data as obtained from FiveThirtyEight on October 17th.
-   `data/analysis_data` contains the cleaned dataset that was constructed for analysis.
-   `model` contains the fitted models. 
-   `other` contains relevant literature, details about LLM chat interactions, and sketches.
-   `paper` contains the files used to generate the paper, including the Quarto document and reference bibliography file, as well as the PDF of the paper. 
-   `scripts` contains the R scripts used to simulate, download and clean data.


## Statement on LLM usage
Some parts of the code and writing were created using the auto-complete tool, ChatGPT. ChatGPT-4 is used when writing the abstract, introduction, appendix, and data simulation code, with the full chat history documented in inputs/llms/usage.txt.
